<p><b>5. Commenting Guidelines</b></p>

<p>The Good Food Guide website is a place for intelligent discussion and for users to offer advice. Heated debates are welcome, but you must stick to our simple guidelines set out below.

    These guidelines are here to promote healthy debate and help new users fit in. We will consider suspending or banning users who do not respect the following:
    Keep your posts friendly
    Please keep comments relevant to the topic at hand. Veering off to add colour to your point is fine, but off-topic posts may be removed.
    Avoid purposefully provoking users into a desired emotional response, or ‘trolling’.
    Although you should feel free to type in a way that’s comfortable and natural for you, it’s important we understand what you’re saying.
    Try to stay away from ‘text talk’ as it can be difficult to decipher. Also, avoid writing in capitals, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU’RE SHOUTING.
    You can post text from an outside source if it does not infringe the rights of any third party and is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement describing the work and crediting its author.
    We may remove posts that others may find offensive, harassing, threatening or abusive or we consider to be defamatory. Language that’s vulgar, obscene, sexually orientated, racist, sexist, homophobic or hateful is not welcome. Please do not link to sexual, pornographic, hateful, defamatory or illegal images or websites.
    Do not 'spam' or promote your business. As a business owner you may interact with members on the forums and answer their questions, but you should make it clear who you are at all times.
    We’d like you to help us to keep the community running smoothly. So if you spot a comment that breaches these guidelines, please bring them to our attention through the ‘Inaccurate / offensive?’ button.

Don’t forget that these guidelines apply in addition to the rest of the terms in these Terms and Conditions.</p>
